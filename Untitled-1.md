And let's do a quick preview to see where we are.

And there is our search button

with our call to action buttons under the hero component and text the three menus and the user menu.

Notifications and our search.

And there is the preview of my searches.

OK.

See where that takes us, actually.

And there is

the account preview.

That's the record detail, as we can see from here. If I click back to the builder, it's going to

take me to this page in the Builder if I want to go back to my home page.

There we go.

Remember our page configuration

is in here, Page Properties.

I don't know why it's not showing right now, but that's that's where it would go for the page properties.

Back to Builder.

Was hoping the page properties would show up after I went back to builder and then let me just published this.

And if it takes too long, it's going to do it behind the scenes and we're going to get an email.

There we go.

Got it.
